Fluentd Setup: Deployed Fluentd as a DaemonSet to collect logs from all running pods across the Kubernetes cluster, implementing RBAC for security.
Elasticsearch Deployment: Utilized a StatefulSet for Elasticsearch to ensure stable network identities and persistent storage for managing collected logs.
Kibana Integration: Set up Kibana to provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing and analyzing log data, facilitating quick insights and decision-making.

Achievements:
Successfully configured a centralized logging solution that streamlines log collection and visualization.
Enhanced application monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities, leading to quicker identification of issues and performance bottlenecks.
Gained hands-on experience with Kubernetes, improving my skills in managing stateful applications in cloud environments.`,
